This authentication system is built using NodeJS, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime, and uses the bcrypt library for password hashing and verification. Bcrypt is a widely-used library that securely hashes passwords and protects against common password vulnerabilities.

When a user registers for an account on this system, their login credentials (username and password) are securely stored in a MongoDB cluster. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable way to store and retrieve data.

To authenticate a user, your system retrieves the login credentials from the MongoDB cluster and verifies the password using the bcrypt library. If the password is correct, the user is granted access to the system.

By using bcrypt for password hashing and verification, and storing login credentials in a secure MongoDB cluster, this authentication system provides a high level of security and protection for user data.
